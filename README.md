# Patient-Survival-Prediction
Patient survival prediction using machine learning

**Introduction**

This project addresses the imperative of enhancing patient survival prediction through advanced machine learning techniques, emphasizing dimensionality reduction and classification. Motivated by seminal works such as "The use of data mining techniques to predict mortality and length of stay in an ICU" by Alramzana Nujum Navaz et al., "Predicting ICU death with summarized patient data" by K.M.D. Muthumali Karunarathna, and "A Comparison of Intensive Care Unit Mortality Prediction Models through the Use of Data Mining Techniques" by Sujin Kim et al., the focus centres on the Kaggle dataset "Patient Survival Prediction" (91,713 rows, 85 columns) from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiatives. By optimizing classification models through dimensionality reduction, we aim to overcome challenges posed by high-dimensional medical datasets, contributing to healthcare analytics research with potential positive implications for clinical decision-making.
